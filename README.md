# RenderWare Exporter
A cli tool I made for future purposes to export and convert dff and txd files to targeted compatible file versions from PC to Android

## Building:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/povias1565/rwexporter
cd rwexporter
git submodule update --init

mkdir build
cd build

# if windows
cmake .. -A Win32

# other OS's
cmake ..
```

# Usage
Just run the output once and the manual can help you.
